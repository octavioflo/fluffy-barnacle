## 📱 Habit Tracker Backend (Spring Boot)

This project is the backend service for a habit-tracking iOS application with accountability and consequences.
Users define habits and optional punishments. If a habit isn’t completed on time, a punishment is triggered—such as
public shaming (posting on social media) or donating to a “bad charity.”
This backend provides all APIs for managing habits, tracking completion intervals, and applying punishments.
